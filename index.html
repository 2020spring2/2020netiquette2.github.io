				<p>1. Write a Simple, Direct Subject Line: This is the first thing the recipient will see of your email, be sure it is accurate to what you are trying to say.</p>
				<p>3. Stick With Classic Fonts: Emails are a formal type of online communication; using a crazy font could give the impression of foolishness, which is not what you want.</p>
				<p>5. Use an Appropriate Email: Your email address says a lot about you, especially since it is one of the first things your recipient will see, this includes your profile picture. Make sure it all sends the message you want it to.</p>
				<p>7. Include a Signature Block: The last line of the email is just as important as the first, a signature block is going to say that you are a proffessional. It will help you be taken seriously is a proffessional environment.</p>
				<p class="ends">9. Write in the Email Address Last: This will make it much less likely to accidentally send an email you haven't proofread yet, it can also make it easier to double check the recipient of the email.</p>

				<p>2. Be Careful of Punctuation: Too many exclamation points can put you in the wrong light; always check your punctuation aswell, you don't want to send an email with bad grammar.</p>
				<p>4. Be Aware of Your Tone: Try to keep a serious tone throughout the email, the last thing you want is to be misinterpretted as a forceful or joking person.</p>
				<p>6. Professional Greetings: The salutations that you use in the email are what set the tone, or the expectations of what the tone will be, for the rest of the email, be careful.</p>
				<p>8. Proofread Your Email: Never send an email that you haven't proofread, leaving an obvious typo in an email is going to broadcast that you don't care enough to double check what you're writing.</p>
				<p class="ends">10. Check the Recipient: When you're sending an email, the last thing you want is for someone unwanted to recieve it, even if the contents isn't private, it's still embarassing to email the wrong person in a professional setting.</p>
